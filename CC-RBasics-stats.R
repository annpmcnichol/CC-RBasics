# Lessons for Ann

#Import edidiv dataset

edidiv <- read.csv("/Users/ann/github/CC-RBasics/edidiv.csv")

# Check data

head(edidiv)                # Displays the first few rows

tail(edidiv)                # Displays the last rows

str(edidiv)                 # Tells you whether the variables are continuous, integers, categorical or characters

#Calculate species richness

Beetle <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Beetle")
# The first argument of the function is the data frame, the second argument is the condition you want to filter on. Because we only want the beetles here, we say: the variable taxonGroup MUST BE EXACTLY (==) Beetle - drop everything else from the dataset. (R is case-sensitive so it's important to watch your spelling! "beetle" or "Beetles" would not have worked here.)

Bird <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Bird")   # We do the same with birds. It's very similar to filtering in Excel if you are used to it.
# You can create the objects for the remaining taxa. If you need to remind yourself of the names and spellings, type summary(edidiv$taxonGroup)

Butterfly <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Butterfly") 
Dragnonfly <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Dragonfly")
Flowering.Plants <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Flowering.Plants")
Fungus <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Fungus")
Hymenopteran <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Hymenopteran")
Lichen <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Lichen")
Liverwort <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Liverwort")
Mammal <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Mammal")
Mollusc <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Mollusc")
